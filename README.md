# Snake-ade

## A word from me
This was just a little project of mine to start getting into the grove of building my own projects without the full help of a course or a youtube tutorial. Albeit I still used, other than the Godot's documentation, some youtube videos on topics that I didin't really understand, but I didin't follow any tutorial for this type of game.

Altogether, i'm really proud on how far i've come in such a short time. This was a really fun experience and I learned a lot from it.

## Game Description
Snake-ade is an arcade style snake game with powerups.

Your goal is to get as many points as you can before dying.


#### Movement
The player has a four direction movement.

- To go **up**, press either "W" or the "up" arrow key.
- To go **down**, press either "S" or the "down" arrow key.
- To go **left**, press either "A" or the "up" arrow key.
- To go **right**, press either "D" or the "right" arrow key.



#### Powerups
There are a total of 4 powerups available at this moment:

- **Point Powerup** - the basic point consumable in a snake game. Awards points depending on the point modifier.
- **Speedup Powerup** - speeds up the player movement for X seconds and doubles the point modifier.
- **Speeddown Powerup** - slows down the player movement for Y seconds.
- **Magnet Powerup** - applies a magnet to the player's head, allowing it to pickup the point powerup from a few tiles away.


#### Skins
There's a skin system skeleton built-in, although there's just one other skin and it's not really a skin, it's just a recolor of the basic snake.


#### Game Over Conditions
The game over conditions are the same as the classic snake game. You die by either:
- Going off screen;
- Colliding with the snake's tail



#### Highscore
This game has a highscore system built-in. Each time you score higher than the last highscore, it is replaced and saved in a file on the user's disk.


## Roadmap
I'm putting this project on the shelf for quite a while. I'm at a phase that I need to output quantity over quality, so i'm going to start working on new and more innovative projects rather than keep perfecting this one. 
There are a lot of things missing in this game and a lot of bugs that I didin't really fix. For example:
- Powerups spawning on the snake's tail and/or the point powerup's position;
- Sometimes, some powerups aren't pickupable;
- The art style is horrendous, but serves as a placeholder to test the mechanics;
- The sounds don't really match the game's vibe all that much. Serves as a placeholder aswell;
- The menu's are horrendous aswell, but the same goes for the placeholder talk;
- I would love to add some shaders, animations and particle effects to the game, but I think i'm going to explore that in my future projects;

However, in the distant future, I might revisit this project to give it a new glow and perspective.
